This Command-Line Interface (CLI) utility is designed to facilitate the systematic removal of 'node_modules' directories. The application empowers users to specify a target directory path, initiating a comprehensive search within all relevant subfolders. In the absence of a designated path, the utility seamlessly defaults to employing the current directory as the operational base.
